The above Document is about a chatbot
Compare and evaluate four major NLU frameworks — Google Dialogflow, Rasa NLU, Microsoft LUIS, and OpenAI GPT — by building and testing a simple chatbot use case across all platforms.
Build the same simple chatbot use case (e.g., FAQ bot or appointment scheduler) using all four NLU frameworks. Then compare them based on:
Customization: How flexible is the framework in training, intents/entities configuration, and domain-specific behavior?
Ease of Use: How easy is it to get started, build, and test your bot?
Deployment: How straightforward is deployment? Cloud/on-premises? SDK availability?
